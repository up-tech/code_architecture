### DRL_VO VS DWA in simulation

#### experimental method

Separately using DRL_VO and DWA finish a sequence of navigation tasks. statistic and compare their total time spent, trajectory length, success ratel.

#### autolab_without_pedestrians

- each env take 1 group test which contains 25 navigation points

#### lobby_with_pedestrians

- every couple of env and method takes 2 trials test and each trial contains 25 navigation points
- there is 4 trials test in the paper. I want to save some time, so I only did half of it

  1. collision may cause ped data deviation, this issue can reduce the success rate of drl_vo
  2. collision seems severe when using dwa. if these is 55 pedestrians in the environment its hard to finish all the navigation in a trail  with dwa
